Hi there! I am a Master student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of University of Maryland, College Park. I am a member of Perception and Robotics Group [(PRG)](http://prg.cs.umd.edu/) under the guidance of Professor [Yiannis Aloimonos](http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~yiannis/) and Dr. [Cornelia Ferm√ºller](http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~fer/). 

My research interests are computer vision and robotics. Currently, I am focussing on gesture recognition and human action understanding.
